-- Case Study #3 - Foodie Fi

-- A. Customer Journey
-- Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

/* 
From the example sample given, focusing on customer 1 for example, we can see that he subscribed to the service for the first time on the date of 2020-08-01.
A week later, his trial (free) plan has over and he downgraded the default pro monthly plan to the basic monthly plan.
This has been his plan since then.

B. Data Analysis Questions

-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM subscriptions

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value.

SELECT MONTHNAME(start_date) AS month, COUNT(*) as count
FROM subscriptions
WHERE plan_id = 0
GROUP BY MONTHNAME(start_date)
ORDER BY start_date

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name.

SELECT plan_name, IFNULL(count, 0) AS count
FROM plans 
LEFT JOIN 
		(SELECT plan_id, COUNT(*) AS count
		FROM subscriptions 
		WHERE YEAR(start_date) > 2020
		GROUP BY plan_id) AS plan_exist_count
	ON plans.plan_id = plan_exist_count.plan_id
  
--4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?

WITH churns AS 
(
	SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS churns_count
	FROM subscriptions
	WHERE plan_id = 4
),
total_customers AS
(
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS total_customers
FROM subscriptions
)

SELECT churns_count, ROUND(churns_count/total_customers * 100, 1) AS percentage 
FROM total_customers, churns
