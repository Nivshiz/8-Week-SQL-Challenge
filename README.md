Link to the Challenge [#8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/)

This is a sql practice challenge.
8 study cases, 8 weeks, lots of SQL questions, easy to hard.

I found this source very challenging, educational and fun, with detailed explanations, entity relationships, tables, and everything you need to practice SQL at a high level.

**My solutions are in MySQL syntax.**
